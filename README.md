##[Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
`Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000`
The way I did was straight forward with a loop and might be slow when the upper bond is incremented. 
The fastest way is doing it mathmatically to calculate the answer directly. Also using python `set`
can get the result within on line which is quite short.
